<!-- repo: in summary / detailed mode, put these sections in place of "## Key points" (the other modes keep their
     shape; tldr: what it is, for whom, how alive). -->

<!-- thread (issue / pull request / discussion): the opening post in the mode's shape under "## The issue" /
     "## The change" / "## The question", then the comments as subskills/shared/discussion.md says under
