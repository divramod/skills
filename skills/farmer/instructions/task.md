# Woken for a FARMER-ROLE.md task (task)

The item names the task. Read its section in the farmer slot's `FARMER-ROLE.md` (`## Tasks` › `### <name>`); it is
the user's word and may widen or narrow your authority for that task only. Log every use of a widened right.

- **not in the machine form**: run its Check and Act as written, then log it
  (`python3 $S/mtm_scan.py record task - "<name>: <what>" --note "<why>"`). Offer the user the machine form
  (Check: backticked commands only; Act: commands and `notify|delegate|wake`) in the notification, as a proposal:
  only the user edits FARMER-ROLE.md.
- **its Check fails while this machine is offline** (exit 75, "check skipped: this machine is offline"): nothing to
  do; production cannot be judged from here, the next round checks again.
- **its Check still fails after the Act** (`wake` in its Still failing): find out why from the Check's output;
  fix it through a servant (`python3 $S/farmer.py delegate --brief <file> --title <title>`) or notify the user.
