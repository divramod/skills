"""The sync duty's rule as code: the farmer branch's FARMER-ROLE.md reaches main, so main and farmer stay alike.

The farmer commits the user's FARMER-ROLE.md edits on its own branch and merges main into it every round, but its
commits reach main only through a landing. When main's FARMER-ROLE.md differs from the farmer branch's, one servant
is told directly (no plan): merge the latest main, then the latest farmer branch, then land it (/mtm), as the
merge-to-main boss's "land now". The farmer merges the new main back in its next round (the frame's stay-current).
