"""A parallel plan's subservant slot (skills plan 0013), as every farmer duty reads it.

A slot whose worktree holds `plans/LEAD` (one line `<lead-slot> <plan> <step>`) runs one step of its lead's plan,
never lands and is measured against its lead's branch `origin/<lead-slot>`, never main. A malformed marker still
marks the slot (bad but marked: no landing, no restart by rule, the report names the broken marker); only a slot
without the file is unmarked. Used by mtm_scan, boss, lead_scan, trains, duties and prune.
