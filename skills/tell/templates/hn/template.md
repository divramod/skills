<!-- hn: what the hn source adds to the shared templates (templates/shared/<mode>.md). -->
<!-- Anchor links: [¶n] paragraph links in ## Article, [→] comment permalinks in ## Discussion; copy them, never build them. -->

<!-- two parts: in every mode except tldr and qa, the mode's own sections go under "## The article", and the
     discussion follows as its own part (subskills/shared/discussion.md). tldr: one line for the article, one for
     the thread's verdict. -->
## The article
<the mode's sections for the linked article (or the Ask HN question), with ¶ links>

## The discussion
<one line: how many comments, and the thread's overall reaction>

### <theme, most discussed first>
<one or two sentences on the position>
> "<verbatim quote>" (**<author>**, [→](<permalink>))

### Where people disagree
<the split, one quote from each side>

### Uncommon but interesting
- <a minority view or first-hand report> (**<author>**, [→](<permalink>))

<!-- related section: last, for every mode that has links -->
## Past discussions
- [<title>](<HN url>) (<date>, <n> comments): <one line: how it differed> ([summary](<path from hn/related.py>), only when already summarized)
<from scripts/hn/related.py, at most 5 with comments; leave the section out when there are none>
